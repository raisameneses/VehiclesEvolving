# VehiclesEvolving
Abstract
	The objective of this research is understanding how principles of biology, evolution, genetics and psychology can be used to write software programs capable of learning to perform a task and improve overtime without concrete human specifications. For this project, we focused specifically on reproduction, mutation, recombination, neurons and genetic encoding. 

Our experiment makes use of  evolutionary robotics and neural networks in order to develop autonomous vehicles that perform actions without receiving direct instructions. We  were inspired by the Braitenberg vehicles, a series of hypothetical, self-operating machines that increasingly modify their behavior in order to achieve a goal.  For the purpose of our experiments, the vehicleâ€™s goal is arriving to a light source. The only information given to the vehicle is how bright it is at its current location.
